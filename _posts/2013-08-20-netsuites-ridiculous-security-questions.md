We've been using [Netsuite][1] at work since day one. The app is pretty powerful but the UI and UX are seriously stuck in 1996. A few months ago a window started to pop up requesting the user to answer some security questions. I'm all for improved security but some of these questions are pretty ridiculous...

1.  What was your childhood nickname?
2.  What is the name of your favorite childhood friend?
3.  What street did you live on in third grade?
4.  What school did you attend for sixth grade?
5.  What was your childhood phone number including area code? (e.g., 000-000-0000)
6.  What was the name of your first stuffed animal?
7.  What was the last name of your fourth grade teacher?
8.  In what city did you meet your spouse/significant other?
9.  What is your oldest sibling's birthday month and year? (e.g., January 1900)
10. What is the middle name of your oldest child?
11. What is your oldest sibling's middle name?
12. What is your oldest cousin's first and last name?
13. In what city or town did your mother and father meet?
14. In what city does your nearest sibling live?
15. What is your oldest brother's birthday month and year? (e.g., January 1900)
16. What is your maternal grandmother's maiden name?
17. In what city or town was your first job?
18. What is the name of the place your wedding reception was held?
19. What is the name of a college you applied to but didn't attend?

Guess which action I take every single time this screen pops up?

**Update**: Crap! Looks like Netsuite caught on to me...
