Super stoked to officially launch a little side project. It's called [Skate or Bike](https://skateorbike.com/) and will feature people who sometimes ride 4, and sometimes ride 2 wheels.

The [first interview](https://skateorbike.com/miki-vuckovich/) on the site is with Miki Vuckovich. I emailed him a huge list of questions and the next day, while on a airplane flight, he answered them all **on his iPhone** ðŸ˜³. Thanks again [Miki](https://www.instagram.com/mikivuckovich/), you set the bar high for the next set of people to answer my questions.

A bunch of new interviews are already in the pipeline, so follow Skate or Bike via [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/skateorbike/), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/skateorbike/), [Facebook](https://facebook.com/skateorbikesite/), [Tumblr](http://skateorbike.tumblr.com/) or [RSS](https://skateorbike.com/feed.xml).
